    <P>
    <b>Impossible objects</b> are physical objects that obviously exist yet appear to
    be impossible; see, for example, <a href="http://www.isc.meiji.ac.jp/~kokichis/Welcomee.html">Sugihara's award-winning collection</a>.
    One elegant form of the impossible object is the <b>hypercard</b>, popularized by Martin Gardner in 1978.
    Hypercards are typically made from one complete playing card or index card,
    and yet seem to be impossible; see the figure on the right.

    <P>
    Each letter and numeral in this typeface is represented by a one-flap
    impossible folding or hypercard.
    In our designs, we use a square sheet of paper with crease lines on
    horizontal, vertical, and 45&deg; diagonal lines.
    Each folding angle is orthogonal, that is, &pm;90&deg; or &pm;180&deg;.

    <P>
    Why do these objects seem to be impossible?
    One reason is that the sheet has been <b>twisted</b>, and twisting is
    necessary to form the 3D shape, while the resulting folded state does not
    seem to be twisted.
    A key feature of the folded state is a <b>vertical flap</b> extending from a
    horizontal plane (shaded darker in the folded form), with the property that
    the vertical flap overlaps other material when rotated in either direction
    onto the horizontal plane, thus seeming to be impossible from a single
    sheet of material.

    <P>
    This typeface consists of two main fonts:
    the <b>folded 3D form</b> and the <b>unfolded cut/crease pattern</b>.
    Each folded 3D form is an impossible-object puzzle:
    how can it be cut/folded from a square of paper?
    Each cut/crease patterns is also a (straightforward) puzzle:
    what letter/numeral does it fold into?
    To reveal the solutions to both puzzles, you can display both fonts
    side-by-side using the &ldquo;<b>both</b>&rdquo; font.
    By default, we render all letters in upper case (because these letters
    have been more carefully design to have correct heights);
    if you want to include <b>lower-case letters</b>, please check the box.

    <P>
    If you'd like to see <b>animations</b> of the folding process
    (which really helps show the twisting that happens),
    download one of the following SVG cut/crease patterns and load them
    into <a href="https://origamisimulator.org/">Origami Simulator</a>:
    <span id="links"></span>.
    You can also print these out to try making an impossible object yourself.
    Red lines are mountain folds; blue lines are valley folds;
    lighter lines fold 90&deg; while darker lines fold 180&deg;;
    and green lines are cuts.

    <P>

    <P>
<!--
    This font looks somewhat better in Firefox which can properly render the
    gradients in the vertical flaps; Chrome currently has
    <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=572685">a bug</a> which prevents this.
